# Texture ID Generator
this is a simple script that i use to generate my texture ids within my odin projects. generally i add this into my build/run scripts whenever i'm editing a project, usually with the line:
`python3 gen_tex_id.py` on windows, and
`py gen_tex_id.py` on macOS/linux.

## Usage
you can add this to your tools/scripts folder within your project directory. you may change the directory and name of the generated file, the package name, and the name of the generated enum with the respective constants at the top of the file.
